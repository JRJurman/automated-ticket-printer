# Ticket Printer
This project is an automated solution to print tickets and items as they get
assigned. It is a library that exposes object standards and a server for making
new ticket sources (github, jira, trello, etc...) and printers easy to connect
to each other.

## Installation
This is a Node.js project, and requires npm and node to build the project. First
clone or download the repository from github, and then run `npm install` in the
root directory to install all the dependencies.

## Building, Testing, and other Scripts
This project contains several npm scripts to help build and test the project.  
- `npm run build`: builds the project into `dist/ticket-printer.js`, happens
after `npm install` by default.  
- `npm test`: runs mocha tests on the project
- `npm run test:ci`: runs mocha tests and returns a report to be read by
circleci, happens after making a PR or new branch on github.
- `npm run test:debug`: runs mocha tests with a debugger that can be inspected
on port 5858. You can use a node-debugger (such as atom's `Node Debugger`) to
attach and inspect the process.

## Running
This project has no executable, but it has example scripts in the
`example_scripts` directory, which show basic use cases and demonstrate how to
use the bundled objects.

## System Design
This project uses a combination of `watches`, `hooks`, and `printers` to get
and print tickets at either a time interval, or on tiggered events.

### `ActivityWatcher`
The `ActivityWatcher` is the server that collects `watches`, `hooks`, and
`printers` and acts as a mediator. `watches` and `hooks` do not need to know how
their tickets will be printed, and `printers` do not need to know how to get new
tickets, or who to get them from.

#### `#constructor([environment])`
Builds the `ActivityWatcher` object, and can take in an environment variable for
specific settings when running.

```javascript
var ActivityWatcher = require('ticket-printer').ActivityWatcher;
var aw = new ActivityWatcher({printLogs:true});
```

#### `#start(printInterval)`
Kicks off all the watches, and creates a loop that checks the print queue for
new tickets at the `printInterval`. `printInterval` should be in milliseconds,
and should be faster than any of the watches, unless you want tickets to build
up before printing them. If there is more than one ticket in the queue, they
will all be printed (for more information, look at `printQueue` below).  

```javascript
var ActivityWatcher = require('ticket-printer').ActivityWatcher;

var aw = new ActivityWatcher({printLogs:true});
aw.start(1000);
```

#### `#addPrinter(printer)`
Adds a printer object for watches and hooks to print to. You can use a bundled
printer or you can write your own printer (look at `printers` section).

```javascript
var ActivityWatcher = require('ticket-printer').ActivityWatcher;
var consolePrinter = require('ticket-printer').consolePrinter;

var aw = new ActivityWatcher();
aw.addPrinter(consolePrinter);
```

#### `#addWatch(watch, interval)`
Adds a watch object for printing tickets at an intervals. This is useful if you
can not add your own hooks to a project or organization. The interval is an
integer in milliseconds to check for new tickets from the watch. This is
attached to the watch as `._interval`, so that the watch can be kicked off in
`#start` (read above). You can use a bundled watch or you can write your own
watch (look at `watches` section).

```javascript
var ActivityWatcher = require('ticket-printer').ActivityWatcher;
var timeWatch = require('ticket-printer').timeWatch;

var aw = new ActivityWatcher();
aw.addWatch(timeWatch, 1000);
```

#### `#addHook(hook)`
Adds a hook object for printing tickets when an event occurs.  
**TODO: This has yet to be defined**

#### `#reset()`
Stops watches from running and removes all watches, hooks, and printers. It also
stops the print check that happens after `#start`, and clears the print queue,
if there were any tickets leftover.

```javascript
var ActivityWatcher = require('ticket-printer').ActivityWatcher;
var timeWatch = require('ticket-printer').timeWatch;

var aw = new ActivityWatcher();
aw.addWatch(timeWatch, 1000);
aw.watches; // -> [ timeWatch ]

aw.reset();
aw.watches; // -> []
```

### `tickets`
Tickets are objects which are generated by `watches` and `hooks`, and are passed
on to (possibly multiple) printers by the `ActivityWatcher`. They have the
following properties:  
- `watch`, a string, the name of the watch
- `title`, a string, the title of the ticket
- `project`, a string, the project that the ticket belongs to
- `number`, a string, the id or number of the ticket
- `body`, a string, the text content of the ticket

```javascript
var exampleTicket = {
  watch: "Example Watch",
  title: "Messages are lost in queue",
  project: "Chats-R-Us",
  number: "#27a",
  body: "When sending messages using ..."
};
```

### `printQueue`
The `printQueue` is a queue that lives in ActivityWatcher. It is passed to the
`getTicketObjects` function, which then can enqueue tickets to be printed
whenever the `ActivityWatcher` loops around to check it (see `#start` above). It
will always be a list of tickets to print, and pops off those tickets as it
sends them to all the printers. If there are no printers, tickets are still
popped off the queue.

### `watches`
Watches are javascript objects which are queried for tickets at a given time
interval. This is valuable when hooks are not available (due to permissions or
availability) and manually checking via an API call would be easier. Watches
need to be added to an `ActivityWatcher`, and print to all the `printers` added
to the `ActivityWatcher`.  

Watches are expected to have the following properties:  
- `name`, which maps to a string.  
- `getTicketObjects`, which maps to a function that takes in a printQueue to
mutate, and returns nothing. To print tickets in order, the `unshift` function
should be used to push tickets onto the queue. Look at `printQueue` above for
more details.

```javascript
var exampleWatch = {
  name: "My First Watch",
  getTicketObjects: function( printQueue ) {
    printQueue.unshift({
      watch: "Example Watch",
      title: "Messages are lost in queue",
      project: "Chats-R-Us",
      number: "#27a",
      body: "When sending messages using ..."
    });
  }
};
```

### `printers`
Printers are javascript objects which can print a ticket object. They are
automatically triggered by the `ActivityWatcher` when new tickets are found.
Except for testing, it is rare that you call the functions directly.  

Printers are expected to have the following properties:  
- `name`, which maps to a string.
- `printTicket`, which maps to a function that takes a ticket object

```javascript
var examplePrinter = {
  name: "My First Printer",
  printTicket: function(ticket) {
    console.log(ticket.name + ": " + ticket.body);
  }
};
```

### `hooks`
**TODO: This has yet to be defined**

## Bundled Objects
With this project, there are several bundled examples to make understanding and
working with this project easier.

### `timeWatch`
This is a bundled watch that always returns a single ticket with the current
time.

### `consolePrinter`
This is a bundled printer that prints the ticket to the console.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork this
repository and make a Pull-Request. PRs should include new tests and
documentation updates. Commits should be semi-formal. While the PR's description
will be review first-and-foremost, commits should have a present-tense single
line that details what will be added.
