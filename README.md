# Ticket Printer
Print your github / jira / trello tickets in real life!

## Purpose
Over the course of the last few years, I've kept track of my work items by
writing them on post-it notes, and then putting them on my laptop, monitors,
etc, and then putting them on a makeshift spindle (2 paperclips) when I was done
.

_The past_  

This project is an automated solution to print tickets and items as they get
assigned to me, and then stick them on a rack to be kept before sticking them on
a real spindle!

## Why the Tessel?
While the Tessel isn't really required, the motivation for the project actually
came from looking through Tessel's supported modules, which landed me here:

I'm basically using this as a reason to get a Tessel 2.
